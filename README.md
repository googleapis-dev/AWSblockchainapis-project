A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

# Building out with managed services

Now Blockchain is focusing on building more microservices with Google Cloud managed services. "It makes sense to see what we can do with Google Cloud products, instead of spinning up our own VMs and managing the whole backup, failover strategy," says Lewis. The company is already expanding its use of Cloud SQL as a managed database with strong consistency at scale, and Stackdriver for logging metrics and analysis.

"So many companies would benefit from Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy," he adds. "It's super powerful, and makes it really easy to authenticate and activate applications based on Google Workspace accounts. That's huge for us because we have a lot of internal and back-office applications that can now be managed through granular, role-based access rights."
